# Sending Output from Inspire Scaler to Apache Kafka

This is the companion repository for the article *Sending Output from Inspire Scaler to Apache Kafka* posted on my [personal website](https://robertwtucker.com). For additional context, please see [the article](https://robertwtucker.com/posts/scaler2kafka).

If a Kafka installation is not available, see [Using the Docker Demo Environment](/posts/kafka2scaler/#using-the-docker-demo-environment) in a related post for details on creating one in Docker.
